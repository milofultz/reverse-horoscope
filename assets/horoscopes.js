        "Independent and enigmatical, _____s are unique. There is no one quite like a _____, and because each is so incredibly individual, it can be tough to describe them as a group. _____s don't like labels, and may shy away from any adjective - even the good ones you might bestow upon them. _____s believe in the nature of change and evolution, and even though they're a fixed sign, they may not necessarily believe they are the \"same\" people they were when they were born.",
        "_____s have a strong sense of social justice and making the world a better place, and see themselves as just one link in an endless human chain. They are very concerned about others, not because of how others treat them or how they want others to treat them.",
        "_____ is intellectual and analytical, but don't mistake these attributes for aloofness. _____s have deep passion, but they know jumping into something too quickly can cause more harm than good. _____s are often big-picture thinkers who can see connections in a way that eludes others. _____s have energy, warmth, and a deep desire to get things done. They feel they're on the planet to change the world and they will do so. _____s are idealistic, and will never accept \"good enough\" until they truly believe it's good enough.",
        "_____s can sometimes seem as if they don't care about their individual relationships, or they are holding something else at a higher value. For example, a _____ may cancel a date at the last minute because a friend or family member is stuck and needs a ride. It's not personal, and it's not a bad thing. A _____ has a value system that's constantly prioritizing the people who need them the most, and sometimes, that puts the people they love in a lurch. Clear communication is necessary to avoid these issues.",
        "Their belief in the innate goodness of people. A _____ will never doubt you, even when you doubt yourself. Their ability to see the best in all people, even if people don't see those qualities in themselves. _____s can lift people up, lightening the mood in the process.",
    ],
    "Aries": [
        "The first sign of the Zodiac, _____ are the trailblazers. Passionate and independent, _____ will never do something just because everyone else is doing it - a _____ needs to be 100 percent committed to the task at hand. Competitive to the max, the best way to motivate a _____ is to turn something into a contest. _____ will put everything they have (and then some) into winning. Loyal, smart, and impulsive, they always have multiple projects on their mind, and won't be satisfied until their work, social life, and personal lives line up exactly with the dream life they've envisioned. Those who are drawn to magnetic _____ may have trouble keeping up - but if they can, they'll have a friend for life.",
        "A _____ will always tell you what they're thinking, with a frankness that may occasionally border on rudeness. But even if a _____ seems overly blunt with their opinion, that's only because _____s value honesty above all else. And it works both ways. While a _____ may be the first to say if they think that you just phoned in a project, they'll also be the first to compliment you for a job well done. _____s may also have a short fuse. That fiery temper can be an asset. When a _____ is angry, they'll never play the passive-aggressive card. But for people who don't know them well, their temper can be a turn off. Learning how to work out their anger - whether by going to the gym every day, taking some deep breaths, or learning to chill before they Tweet their thoughts to the world - is a lifelong process for _____s.",
        "When it comes to love, _____ are all about initial attraction. They can sense chemistry in the first sentence uttered by a potential partner. Forthright and unabashed, a _____ will do everything in their power to go after someone they want. Sometimes, they need to learn how to slow down and foster long-term connections. Fireworks are fun, but they don't necessarily make a great match. _____ are amazing lovers: versatile, passionate, and always invested in the moment.",
        "Whether it's backpacking around the world, launching a business, or training for a marathon, once a _____ sets a goal, they will achieve it. They don't care what anyone else thinks, and can tune into their intuition and dreams in a heartbeat. _____s never need a plus one - they love their own company, and consider going solo to the movies a rare treat.",
        "The world according to a _____ makes so much sense that they have a hard time listening to, much less accepting, alternative viewpoints. Slowing down is also tough. A _____'s mind goes a million miles a minute, and slowing down for others can be excruciating. But when it comes to maintaining relationships, _____ must learn to adapt and embrace other ways of doing, being, and seeing.",
        "Strong, adamant, and forged in fire, it's fitting that _____' secret weapon is iron, one of the strongest elements. Weld, cast, machine, forge, temper, harden, or anneal it, iron can take on a seemingly limitless range of shapes and qualities. For a _____, an iron-rich diet can boost confidence and performance.",

    "Cancer": [
        "Emotional, intuitive, and practically psychic; ruled by the moon and characterized by the _____, _____ has so much going on in its watery depths. _____s may seem prickly and standoffish at first meeting, once they make the decision to become friends with someone, that person has a friend for life.",
        "Most _____s have been called psychic at some point, and with good reason - _____ can often intuit relationships, ideas, and motivations before anyone has actually spoken. That can make for challenging interactions with this sign - _____ hates small talk, especially when it contains white lies (like saying, \"How nice to see you!\" when it's clear that both parties would rather avoid each other). That's why social gatherings can be overwhelming for _____s. They'd much rather spend time in small groups where everyone is on the same page.",
        "In romance, _____ is a giving and generous lover and expects the same in return. The _____ is above mind games and hates the thrill of the chase - if you love someone, why not say it now? It's not uncommon for _____ to fall into committed love after just a few days or weeks, and even though that decision is sudden, it can easily last a lifetime. _____s tends to be happiest when they're part of a pair, and the best relationship brings out their greatest traits. But even though a _____ thrives in a duo, he or she also has an independent streak, and needs plenty of time to do things solo. This sign has an active internal life, and is often are happy living in the realm of imagination. Sometimes _____s need help from one of the more grounded signs to make their dreams a reality.",
        "_____ loves creating and needs some type of creative outlet, whether it's painting, writing, or even just reading. _____ also loves connecting to a higher power, and may find comfort in religion or spiritual practices. And even though _____s can be intense, they also have a funny side with a wry sense of humor, and they're adept at observing and mimicking people around them.",
        "Finally, _____ is incredibly loyal, sometimes to a fault. _____s will go to the ends of the earth and even against their own beliefs to help someone they love. Learning how to step up for what they believe in - even if it means turning down or against a friend - is a lifelong lesson for _____. As the emotional heart of the Zodiac, this sign teaches everyone else that, while there's so much in life that we may not be able to see, we should still pay attention to the unseen because it does exist - and we do need it!",
        "With off-the-charts emotional intelligence, _____ quickly cuts through the BS and noise to the heart of an issue. _____s don't need all the facts and figures to know the right course of action, and their ability to trust intuition without judgment can aid them well. This gift is one that other Zodiac signs can learn from and be inspired by.",
        "While _____ easily and accurately reads situations when they're presented, he or she may not share those opinions with others. Speaking up is key, because turning inward with emotions means that those emotions may erupt unexpectedly. _____s also expect others to know what they're thinking, which is another source of pent-up frustration. Learning to voice opinions, even if it leads to conflict, is a lifelong lesson for _____.",
        "Emotions. While many _____s probably get the message to \"be less emotional,\" the huge range and depths of _____s' emotions may in fact be their secret weapon. When this sign is happy, the world knows it; when they're unhappy, the world will work to shift their situation. In general, a _____'s mercurial moods do a better job than a long speech, and by sharing their emotions with the world, _____s help other signs tap into theirs as well.",

    "Capricorn": [
        "Smart, hardworking, and fully in control of their destiny, a _____ will always get what they set their mind to, in both personal and professional life - no excuses. _____s may get a reputation as stubborn, but they simply know what they want, and also know how they wish other people would behave.",
        "Natural rule-followers, _____s thrive on order and love strict rules, hierarchies, and set ways to do things. Can a _____ think outside the box? Yes, they can, but they prefer when they have strict boundaries to constrain against - free reign can make them feel paralyzed by choice. _____s are great at climbing the corporate ladder, and especially adept at making (and investing) money. _____s love family, and put a lot of stock in traditions. A _____ might stress themselves out trying to do everything perfectly - a _____ may feel like they must present a home-cooked meal every day, and would never admit to doing drive-thru or takeout. _____s believe presentation is everything, and their homes are usually Insta-worthy. A _____ sometimes is overly focused on what things look like, instead of how things feel, which could cause them to feel stifled and unhappy.",
        "_____ needs to find a firm sense of self beyond how others perceive them, and recognize that racking up achievements is only one small part of their personality.",
        "_____s are loyal friends, and have a funny and sly sense of humor when you get to know them - it is fun drawing them out of their shells. In love, _____ is a true partner, who is laser-focused on helping their partner find success and happiness. A _____ will dive into a relationship like a job, and believes that hard work can help make a bond as strong as possible. While sometimes a romantic conversation may veer toward feeling a bit like a board meeting, especially with action items and improvement plans, but if you roll with it, they have a point: Your bond will be stronger.",
        "_____ is intelligent, detail-oriented, and will not take no for an answer when they want something. Their hard working attitude is an inspiration to all, and they truly believe they can achieve anything with hard work. _____ is always ready to learn new skills, and sees something they don't know - like changing a tire or boiling the perfect egg - as a challenge they must undertake. This attitude makes them a master of all trades, and they have esoteric knowledge that is impressive to all who know them.",
        "_____s can be incredibly hard on themselves, and just as hard on other people. They can hold grudges and hold other people in their lives to impossible standards. _____s sometimes see one narrow way of doing something, and broadening their horizons and perspective can be incredibly helpful in giving them and others a break.",
        "Their tenacity. They believe that they truly can do anything, and they will dig in and get it done, no matter how exhausting or tedious the task. _____ will stay up all night if necessary and are almost superhuman in terms of being able to ignore exhaustion and laser focus on the task at hand.",

    "Gemini": [
        "Smart, passionate, and dynamic, _____ is characterized by the _____, Castor and Pollux, and is known for having two different sides they can display to the world. Expert communicators, _____ is the chameleon of the Zodiac, adept at blending into different groups based on the vibe and energy they perceive. While they're also amazing at showcasing surface traits, the _____ well runs deep, which is why the _____ are one of the Zodiac's most emotionally intelligent signs.",
        "Energetic and quick-witted, _____ never gets stuck in the past and doesn't ruminate on what might have been. Instead, they move forward with glass-half-full optimism and an ability to always look on the bright side - and land on their feet - in nearly any situation. With a mind that's constantly racing, even when they're just quietly hanging out, the _____ never get bored. In fact, _____ are happy keeping their own company, and can often turn their solitary daydreams into reality.",
        "_____ are in love with love, and they adore the ritual of it all, from those \"do they like me?\" butterflies to the anticipation of a back-and-forth text volley. _____ loves dating, and the world loves _____. But a _____ will eventually settle down, because this sign is incredibly loyal and steadfast once they've chosen a partner. Let's be clear, though: Steadfast isn't a code word for boring. _____ always love to keep things fresh and are happy to try almost anything in the bedroom. They're proud of their sexuality and depend on frequent physical check-ins to keep them grounded in their body. To them, sex is a celebration of life, and _____ loves both sex and life.",
        "Despite their unfair rep for being two-faced, once a _____ is in your life, they're loyal for life - but they aren't afraid to voice their opinion if they feel you're doing something they disagree with or if they perceive you as not being loyal to them. Always a sign to see all sides of the situation, _____ may seek input from friends before going to the root of the problem. It's not gossiping - it's gathering information.",
        "And even though _____ is easily the life of the party without trying, the _____ also have a deep emotional side that needs care and feeding. _____ like time by themselves to read, create, daydream, and come up with other ways of sharing their gifts with the world. When a _____ can truly tap in and share their gifts, they're an unstoppable force of energy that can motivate, inspire, and enchant the rest of the Zodiac.",
        "Equipped with almost uncanny emotional intelligence, _____ can easily read a room and know exactly what other people want to hear from them. They can easily shift their personality depending on mood, going from Friday night life of the party to Monday morning office superstar. Energetic and passionate, _____ can breathe new life into a same-old routine and excite other people simply by their all-in presence.",
        "That social chameleon rep can sometimes earn _____ a reputation as two-faced. While a _____ is all about truth, sometimes a _____ is more likely to talk to others about a conflict instead of approaching the person who's actually causing it. The _____ have also been known to stir up gossip just to keep things exciting.",
        "Intelligence. _____ is quick-witted and can read a room or situation in an almost supernatural way. Without saying very many words, a _____ soon knows who has an agenda, who's a good ally, and who may need someone to bolster them up. Because of this, _____ is an amazing friend, leader, and person everyone should be lucky to have in their lives.",

    "Leo": [
        "Bold, intelligent, warm, and courageous, fire sign _____ is a natural leader of the Zodiac, ready to blaze a trail, vanquish injustice, and make a name for themselves along the way. Blessed with high self-esteem, _____s know that they possess enviable traits - and they're proud of them. They don't believe in false modesty and will be the first to praise themselves for a job well done. But _____ isn't self-aggrandizing or unwilling to roll up those sleeves and do the work: this sign knows that in order to be respected and admired, he or she needs to put in the effort worthy of a leader.",
        "But it's not all hard work for _____s. Intense and energetic, _____s thrive on social interactions and have no problem making friends - although pinning them down to spend time with you is another story. _____s put themselves first, and will turn down a plan that doesn't fit with their agenda or idea of fun. This trait has gained them an unfair reputation for arrogance. But on the flip side, when a _____ chooses to spend time with you, it's genuinely because he or she wants to.",
        "_____s are passionate in all pursuits, including relationships, and take it upon themselves to be the best partner you've ever had. They love grand gestures, and they want to show the world how attentive and caring they can be. They also can't resist flashiness and often buy their partner the biggest and best presents. _____ is an adventurer, seeking to balance an intense life of social obligations and travel with plenty of downtime to relax and luxuriate. Work and outward appearances matter to this sign, and they're willing to do whatever it takes to gain a job title or workplace status, even if it means temporarily sacrificing their precious leisure time.",
        "Benevolent with their time and attention, _____s are never cliquey, always showing friendliness and politeness to everyone. While almost everyone else is entranced by the _____nine personality, _____s are their own harshest critic and consider each day a challenge to be the best, brightest, and boldest _____ they can be.",
        "A natural leader, _____'s very presence inspires others to be the best they can be. But with great power comes great responsibility. _____s love the pull of the limelight, and they're occasionally swayed by what other people want (or expect) them to do. Although this sign has a loud inner voice, learning to listen to it - especially if it's guiding them toward an unpopular move - is a lifelong lesson that will only make proud _____s stronger and more resilient.",
        "_____s are well known for their loud roar. But learning to quiet down and listen is essential for _____s to reach their peak power - especially when they're hearing a voice that doesn't match their confidence and certainty. And while this sign thrives on their split-second decision-making and reaction skills, they might sometimes benefit from taking a few seconds, minutes, or even days before making their opinion known on a subject. Researching all sides, doing due diligence, and learning from other people's experiences are all essential for a _____ to be as strong a leader as possible.",
        "A giving nature. Most people assume that _____s are all about themselves. But appearances are deceiving. A _____'s secret weapon is his or her boundless capacity for love, affection, and generosity.",
    ],
    "Libra": [
        "Intelligent, kind, and always willing to put others before themselves, _____s value harmony in all forms. Ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty, _____ adores a life that looks good. As the master of compromise and diplomacy, _____ is adept at seeing all points of view, and excels at crafting compromises and effecting mediation between others. This sign has a rich inner life yet loves other people, and they're always happiest with a large group of friends, family, and coworkers on whom they can count.",
        "Working with detail-oriented signs, like _____s or _____s, can help _____s actually manifest their dreams into reality, especially in the workspace. But don't call out _____s for daydreaming - their imagination is one of their biggest assets, and they often put their imagination to work by finding careers in the arts or in literature.",
        "_____s believe that they're directing their own lives, and they take a big-picture approach in making that life look and feel the best it can be. They spend a lot of time figuring out what's missing from that big picture, and they may feel unhappy if they become too focused on one thing, whether it's work, a partner, or a family member. _____s are at their best when they balance their schedule to include plenty of time for self-care rituals and personal pursuits, and when they give themselves enough flexibility to change focus.",
        "When _____ falls in love, he or she falls hard, but this sign also recognizes that there's room for more than one grand love in his or her life. The Scales are pragmatic about love, realizing that different relationships often have different seasons. _____s can sometimes be accused of being too pragmatic, and they've been known to call off a relationship pre-emptively if they feel it may not work due to distance, age difference, or another external conflict.",
        "Although _____ appears self-confident to outsiders, he or she might struggle with insecurity, especially as it relates to personal identity, which sometimes feels mutable. This sign's lifelong question is: \"Who am I?\" They may find their identity shifting based on where they are in their lives and who they're spending time with. In order to feel more confident in their identity, social _____s need to get comfortable spending time with themselves and getting to know their gut and their internal voice.",
        "_____ is fiercely attracted to intelligence, which is just as important as appearance when it comes to the partners they end up falling for. This sign is all about cerebral connections - role-playing, dirty talk, and games in the bedroom all serve to amp up their interest. Physical connection is nice, but a sexy Snap can truly crank up a _____'s libido.",
        "_____'s everyday vibe is this gentle reminder: \"Let's just all get along.\" For this sign, compromise is key. _____s don't do well when anyone in their orbit isn't happy, and they're especially adept at inviting other signs to see things from a different perspective. A _____ doesn't strong arm or use coercion, but rather relies on his or her communication prowess to help everyone see another side to a story.",
        "_____ is great at making everyone happy - but what good is that if _____s themselves don't feel fulfilled? While the Scales have a fine-tuned internal compass, they sometimes ignore what they want in favor of what makes everyone else happy - and this habit ends up backfiring in the long run.",
        "This sign has weaponized their imagination in the service of good. _____s' imagination is unmatched, and they can always come up with a new way of looking at an issue. _____ is also blessed with boundless creativity. Even if they're working in a data-dominated field, their creativity shows them novel ways to see things.",

    "Pisces": [
        "Smart, creative, and deeply intuitive, _____ can be close to psychic. _____ feel things deeply, and have incredibly strong gut reactions. A _____ \"knows\" things from deep within, and can often judge whether a person or situation is good or bad. That doesn't mean a _____ ignores the logical part of their brain, though. Deeply intelligent, _____ have a profound respect for the power of the human mind. Is it a surprise that Albert Einstein was a _____?",
        "_____ are sensitive, and get along well in small groups of people. Sometimes, a _____ may feel like they have an internal and external self, and they may need to spend a lot of time solo to recalibrate those two halves of themselves. A _____ is rarely lonely when they are by themselves, and have an active imagination. Creative, _____ love spending time reading, exploring or creating art or music, and understanding their emotions through art.",
        "_____ may seem quiet but they are incredibly strong and have a very strong sense of right and wrong. Their moral compass, along with their gut, guides them well. When a _____ speaks up, people listen. _____ tend to take in everything around them, and they are great people to ask for advice on pretty much anything. While _____ has strong convictions about the best way for them to live, they have a \"live and let live\" approach when it comes to others, and are accepting and nonjudgmental of all.",
        "A _____ has a great gut and great intuition, which can guide them well, and help them make creative or intellectual leaps other people might not be able to see or consider. Deeply imaginative, _____ can happily spend hours daydreaming, and are often just as surprised as the rest of the world when the pieces come together in an amazing way. _____ don't necessarily work the same way as other people do, and they may be able to get things done incredibly quickly. But it's not that they're that much faster than other zodiac signs. It's that the time they may have been caught staring into space are times that are deeply valuable to them, and necessary for any creative process. The more a _____ understands how they work and respects that process, the better they are.",
        "_____ can sometimes spend too much time in their heads, getting overly wrapped up in a problem and assuming there's no solution. _____ are always one of the first signs to lend an ear to others, but when it comes to asking for help - especially emotional help - _____ can sometimes wall themselves off, assuming that nobody knows what they are feeling and not even giving anyone a chance to try. Learning how to open up can be a huge lesson for _____. Of course, the fact remains that no one can read a _____ mind. _____ sometimes feels frustrated that they are seen as \"more complicated\" than their peers, and that feeling can make them act or seem defensive. _____ needs to learn to let down their guard, allow people to love them, and allow for mistakes to be made.",
        "The realization that life is so much more than what we see. _____ is in tune with the magic of everyday existence and can find beauty in all situations, even ones that may cause tears.

        "_____ is open-hearted, generous, and big-spirited, but _____ is always truthful. Because of this, they may hurt others' feelings, or may be called out for not having tact or empathy. The latter is not true. With their keen imagination, _____ is adept at putting themselves in another person's shoes - that's why so many _____ are successful actors - but they do not feel the need to beat around the bush or lie. You can trust a _____ to tell you what they really think. You can also trust a _____, period. Unlike other signs, they won't spill any secrets.",

In bed, Sags love trying new positions, new toys, and making everything an adventure. Yes to the lights on; yes to lovemaking outside. In relationships, Sags will be honest and true to themselves, and that may mean that they will move on from a relationship.

A _____ loves hanging out with herself, and feels like doing things solo can only help her connect more to her deepest self. _____ uses solo time as a much-needed reboot.
