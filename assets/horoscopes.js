        "There's not only an AM/PM split, but a mood division too. Creatively you'll be on top form and able to impress people with your vision. Emotionally, however, you could tend towards being brusque and dismissive. If you want others to listen and agree, then you'll need to draw on every ounce of tact!",
        "There's a corrective vibe at work. It is likely to be very faint and hard to pin down. That said; you are likely to be more attuned to it than most. This may be useful, since an exchange at some point in the day could be linked back to something forgotten or overlooked in recent times!",
        "Yesterday's fiery zest is likely to give way to thin-skinned sensitivity today. Comments that you'd normally brush off with a laugh may cause you minor stress. The trick is to remember that you'll perhaps overreact to what is nothing more than good-humored banter!",
        "It's a day to double check out-going information and take your time with incoming news. Easily missed errors on a minor level could have a greater impact on work related matters than you realize. Take control, but not in a way that pushes other people's noses out of joint!",
        "Fairly intense planetary mixes could draw your attention to a very recent oversight. The underlying problem may be that you're still investing too much energy into something that has little value at the expense of something that has a lot of untapped potential. It's not a day to ignore little hints and clues!",
        "A seemingly negative development on Monday is likely to act as a discreetly positive catalyst for the remainder of the week. Incoming information may not be what you expect to hear, but it could give way to gentle improvements. a possible bolt from the blue may be subject to further developments.",
        "This will be a great day to stimulate friendships and remember old contacts: write letters; send emails, and arrange a friendly day with your close friends. It's possible that someone is feeling a little neglected or overlooked, so make sure that you don't forget anyone!",
        "You are very likely to slip into quite a flighty mood. If you're working on or dealing with the sort of things that are simple and quick, then you'll be in your element. Those tasks/duties that require a great deal of consideration might test your patience, though!",
        "A certain frame of mind is likely to govern your actions. Your ambitions may well kick into overdrive on the work front, and in terms of romance you won't settle for second best. All that said; it may be that you'll set exacting standards and as such, be very hard to please!",
        "A quietly confident yet gentle approach may be required if you are to resolve a particular issue with regard to a platonic relationship. The Mars/moon mix could make it difficult for you to say what is on your mind. There's a subtle suggestion that you may over-assert yourself!",
        "The morning's vibe may well feel downright inflexible. The block could be in the shape of rules and regulations, or even an inflexible figure. While it may well be possible to get round this obstructive force later in the day, do take care: those boundaries may have a slightly protective quality against unwise decisions!",
        "There's a lot of positive energy buzzing about throughout the day. However, this will also encourage you to take a slight risk. If this risk involves your finances or your reputation on the work/career front, then do think twice. There's an optimum point between being enthusiastic and being pushy!",
        "Planetary shifts may encourage quick reactions on a day where it may not be so easy to rectify any mistakes. While it is nearly always sensible to assess and appraise your options and choices, as opposed to leaping in, there may be one or two moments where you just have to react quickly!",
        "Planetary shifts may have a subtle impact on your perception of one particular situation. You may even need to resist someone's very persuasive language. Rather than just accepting someone's word at face-value, it may be better to conduct your own research, discreetly, if necessary!",
        "The subtly judgmental new moon may bring a trace of doubt over something that may have appeared without complications. If you find that you're revisiting or reassessing a tricky problem or dilemma, then take your time. A little more time may well give you that extra bit of resolve!",
        "It's definitely a mixed day for you today: where the morning may require you to be a little more considerate and patient, the afternoon is more likely to demand a 'full-steam-ahead' approach, either at work or on the home front. Additionally; don't be put off by non-committal responses!",
        "The main vibe of the day may feel far more supportive than yesterday's. That said; there is a propensity to let certain opportunities slide. You will have a little more influence than you realize. A very persuasive way with words could lead to something more this evening. It's certainly not a day to waste!",
        "Romance may not feel as though it is the high point of the day, but a flirty comment drifting your way might just have more substance to it than you realize. With that in mind, do make sure that you're clear about your intentions too. That way there can be no misunderstandings and no crossed wires!",
        "There's a hint of incoming news at some point and a very minor complication may emerge out of it. It may well be that you need to take a backward step or a slower pace in one key area of your life. If you have to shelve a plan don't worry too much: today's slippery vibe will fade!",
        "There's maybe a touch of 'the day after.' It may be that there's some explaining or backtracking to do. If you're the one doing the explaining, do it soon, but if you're on the receiving end, have patience. Be receptive to the little hints that point to a warm vibe this evening!"
    ],
    "Aries": [
        "The spotlight is on you, and normally you'd delight in all the attention, but on a day where lunar influences go from dazzling to confusing, you may well feel a lot happier if you can claim a bit of thinking time. There is a great deal of progress to be made if you can just find the space!",
        "A new face is destined to appear on the scene for you today, and this someone could turn out to be a good friend and confidante. This person will be almost your opposite: introverted, quiet, shy, and who tends to be fretful, but you'll soon take them under your wing!",
        "The fabulous sun/moon aspect is likely to make you feel highly emotional, but in a highly positive way, especially when it comes to romantic matters. For singles there could be what is typically described as a charged atmosphere in the workplace. That said; keep work and romance as far apart as possible!",
        "The fiery new moon will off some potential, but only if utilized in moderate amounts. A tendency to speak as you find may need to be kept under control. In addition to this, a temptation to try and exert influence in the career zone could be met with a little resistance!",
        "The airy moon may appear to generate a very effortless vibe. Solutions and answers could seem to be there for the taking. However; a fickle undercurrent suggests that although the time may seem right for a fresh start of some kind, there is really nothing to be gained by going over old ground!",
        "It's a day where you could find that you're thinking about your short-term future. There's a slightly driven vibe in the ether, which could bode well for career decisions if used realistically and in moderation. Bear in mind; imposing too many conditions could reduce your options a little!",
        "It's a day where hearty influences will continue to create a careless and carefree vibe, and while this could open up minor possibilities, the element of several options and choices may actually be quite limiting. Do be aware that any chopping and changing your mind could rebound in a couple of days!",
        "It's a day where your efforts will seem quite effortless and accomplishments will come easily. The key word is 'seem.' You can afford to take a calculated risk over a decision, but you don't be reckless about it. Opportunities that come your way today should be considered carefully!",
        "Vexing lunar aspects are likely to test your patience: it might feel as though it's a case of one small step forward and two huge steps back. That said; don't become too disheartened by a seemingly counterproductive development: you'll actually be making more progress than you realize!",
        "It's a day where you could find that you're thinking about your short-term future. There's a slightly driven vibe in the ether, which could bode well for career decisions if used realistically and in moderation. Bear in mind; imposing too many conditions could reduce your options a little!",
        "Understated planetary alterations suggest that it's a day where your aims and goals could shift in a subtle way. There's a tendency to move from passive to active and, as a result, you may tend to set your sights on tougher, trickier outcomes and consequences. Take care with a moment of pride!",
        "Improved influences should add just a dash of zest to the day. That said; watch out for a possible clash between your work life and your social zone. There may be a sudden or unexpected deadline to meet. A surprising invitation may well add to a slight sense of growing pressure!",
        "A new face is destined to appear on the scene for you today, and this someone could turn out to be a good friend and confidante. This person will be almost your opposite: introverted, quiet, shy, and who tends to be fretful, but you'll soon take them under your wing!",
        "It's not the warmest day. Something, or even someone, is likely to get right under your skin, and you'll be reluctant to let the matter go. However, while the planets are being a little contrary, it shouldn't last. To avoid any mild embarrassment or regret tomorrow say little today!",
        "A rather complacent Jupiter/moon mix may well impact on the way you interpret rules and regulations. There's a certain airiness that may come across to others as a lack of concern and/or commitment. While you'd prefer to test the unexpected and the unknown, this may not actually be in your best interests!",
        "It may be one of those rather grating days full of minor interruptions. You may find that you're being pulled in several directions throughout. It's also possible that someone will try to hurry you along into making a rash decision. It may be wise to resist any sense of external pressure for now!",
        "Responsibilities and obligations are likely to define the day's subtle undercurrent, so don't be surprised if someone reminds you of an old favor or asks you to honor an ongoing or open-ended promise. Don't allow a previous error or failure to dictate your current responses!",
        "Expect errors when it comes to basic attention to detail, since the chances of making some easily-missed mistakes are higher than usual. In addition; it may be quite hard to get someone to listen to a specific piece of advice. It's not a day to leave things to chance, either!",
        "Improved influences have the capacity to ease the pressure, more or less all-round. That said; the planetary impact on romantic matters may be a little hit-and-miss, since a need for some independence is likely to make you appear a little chilly. Just bear in mind that it will be easy to strike a false note!",
        "It's perhaps a day to enjoy the easier, if impulsive vibe. However; do keep one eye open for any minor but unexpected developments, since there may be a brief opening of some kind. It's certainly not a day to ignore something that has the potential to be quite significant!"
    ],
    "Cancer": [
        "You should find that today's planetary changes bode well for your friendships and for one relationship in particular. Speaking out on behalf of one individual may well provide an important turning point you, as you will be regarded in a new and fresh light by someone who matters!",
        "Knowing when and where to draw the line may not be as easy as it sounds, especially if work-related deadlines are involved. It may not be as straightforward as switching off and walking away. If the pressure is building, then you may need to find a different way to keep going!",
        "Planetary transits are likely to facilitate creative and thoughtful ideas; they may well pave the way for a slight boost on the work/career front. However; what is most likely to work is a step-by-step approach. The idea of backtracking a little may seem unappealing, but sometimes the end result of a second chance is better than the original!",
        "The overriding mood for today is likely to feel a great deal less pressured than of late. There's a certain playful vibe, which will help someone else see you in a new light too. However, you may not be able to let go of something that others regard as quite trivial or unimportant!",
        "If you can resist the afternoon's intense influences, you can reverse any lingering doubts regarding a recent matter. This may be linked to recent news or a sudden announcement. Avoid making mountains out of molehills. It's possible that you just need a little time-out on this one!",
        "It's a day to make the most of a cosmic burst of focused energy. If there are any outstanding jobs that need to be completed, then today is an ideal day for you to clear that to-do list. While it may sound a little dull, there could be an interesting and unexpected side effect!",
        "If a slightly carefree and careless vibe led to minor mistakes yesterday, then today you may sense a slightly pressured and humorless vibe urging you to correct them. It'll be best to respond to valid criticisms gracefully. It's certainly not a day to try and sidestep your responsibilities!",
        "It's a fairly good day, if you can side-step a slight tendency to over-invest in one specific area or activity that is perhaps not worth all your attention. Try to branch out a little; do something different. On the romance front, try not to over-analyze an unexpected exchange!",
        "It's likely to be an odd day. One strand of influences will perhaps muddle practical/ material matters, while another strand may change your mind when it comes to a settled matter or agreement. If possible, it may be best to delay any sudden or rushed amendments!",
        "Routines and schedules are likely to come under the spotlight. There are plenty of opportunities to improve those two key areas, but you will need to maintain an upbeat mood, which may be hard if you're in the company of negative types. However, it's a day to listen to positive feedback!",
        "Yet more planetary shifts are likely to excessively motivational. Flittering from one thing to the next will only drain you. Maintain a steady pace. Recognize from the start that you can't be in two places at once, and that you can't do everything, no matter what someone may say!",
        "Lunar aspects focus on romantic matters and encourage a common sense approach, which will help if you have been harboring unfeasibly high expectations. However, don't let this vibe take over entirely, since it has a slight propensity to be a little chilly. Just use it to correct minor problems!",
        "It's a day to do what you can, given the rather haphazard, unreliable vibe. Just bear in mind that relying on others may not be your best strategy. Incoming advice should be analyzed very carefully before you act on it. If it all gets a little too much, then remember that balance should be restored tomorrow!",
        "Yesterday's slightly fickle vibe is not likely to decrease; in fact, it's likely to continue, and then some, only this time any hesitation over specific decisions may well be down to your emotional responses rather than impatience. The Venus/moon combination suggests that a romantic matter could be at the root of this!",
        "You could find that you're more sensitive to the shifting vibe than you realize. You may begin to question a suggestion. Alternatively; a change of mind or change of plan regarding a personal matter may be the indirect cause of unsettled feelings. If in doubt, then give yourself some time!",
        "A subtly smoldering vibe is likely to have an effect on romance for most signs today. For you, there could be communication from farther afield, particularly for singles. For those already in a relationship, raising a few questions could lead to understated improvements of some kind!",
        "The daytime's slightly idealistic vibe could slow progress and leave you struggling to catch up again later in the week. Part of the problem is that you may assume that you're missing some of the relevant facts. However; it could be that you're a little too preoccupied with far too many intricate details!",
        "The cosmic emphasis is likely to switch to minor miscommunications in emotional matters. That said; it's a day where you're likely to feel a little more in control than you have recently. However; today there could be a fine line between being gently assertive and treading on someone's toes!",
        "It's a day where your prevailing mood may be a little intense. Because of this you're likely to blow hot and cold with those whose responses may seem frustratingly casual. In addition; you may need to bite your tongue as the inclination to tell it like it is becomes overwhelming!",
        "A slightly pressured vibe may well point you in the wrong direction. There's a tendency to attribute far too much importance to trivial developments. The more time you expend on this, the harder it will be to catch up in other areas. By the same token, take extra care with verbally-based agreements"
    ],
    "Capricorn": [
        "There's a slightly high-maintenance vibe about, particularly in the emotional zone. Getting to the root of one particular matter may require a rethink on your part. As an aside; minor but good news could lift your mood, but don't let it distract you from dealing with more immediate problems!",
        "It may be wise to deflect the effects of today's planetary shifts, which impact on material and financial matters. Don't be too adventurous; stick with what you know. Creatively you'll be on a roll, but financially you will really need to keep that burgeoning surge of confidence under some control!",
        "A prickly vibe may seem to materialize out of nowhere. You may need to guard against being slightly too critical with others in your immediate circle. You may also need to take steps to reverse a rather stubborn mood too. It's definitely not a day to try and exert too much control or influence over others!",
        "There's a slightly mixed, disorganized vibe, where what appears to be a negative development may turn out to be quite a positive one. The inverse could apply, but is less likely. This is likely to revolve around a previous romantic development – one that perhaps never got off the ground the first time round!",
        "It may be wise to deflect the effects of today's planetary shifts, which impact on material and financial matters. Don't be too adventurous; stick with what you know. Creatively you'll be on a roll, but financially you will really need to keep that burgeoning surge of confidence under some control!",
        "Given the date it's likely that romance will feature at some point. A subtle hint could actually be a good indicator of someone's feelings, although it may result in a waiting-game. An evening out may well appeal, but unless you resolve a minor work related matter, you won't find it so easy to switch off!",
        "It is possible that something you perhaps shelved or wrote off a while ago regains fresh appeal. That said; it may also be something that you can't develop yet. Your best strategy will be to exercise a little patience. Just bear in mind that this shift may not be immediately obvious or visible!",
        "Balance is what will be missing at the start of the day. Slightly distracting influences may divert your attention from where it is really needed. Workaholic Goats will benefit from slowing down. There's also the strong possibility of excellent news coming in later, which could brighten your mood!",
        "The prevailing vibe may feel obstructive. If anything is missing, it'll be the sense of everyone working together as a team. Wait until this evening for a partial or full vindication over an earlier clash. It's certainly not a good day to put your foot down when it comes to romance!",
        "You may not feel like exerting yourself when it comes to chores and tasks; instead you'll be in an ultra sociable mood, thanks to a couple of strong aspects, including one from Venus. It's also more than possible that you'll meet someone who will turn out to intrigue you more than a little!",
        "It's perhaps a day to keep disconnected matters strictly separated; for example: don't allow work to impinge on leisure and vice-versa. While the overriding vibe is likely to feel a more tranquil than of late, there could be something of a charged atmosphere when it comes to romantic matters!",
        "You might find that you need to handle matters of the heart with care, and don't allow your expectations to dictate too much. The planets are suggesting that you may want to postpone any romantic interludes until after tomorrow, which may bring in a realization or two!",
        "It's a day where louder personalities may appear to have the advantage, but the quieter signs needn't let this impact on a possible opening. Do bear in mind, though that you may develop a temporary inclination to give in or settle for second-best, especially when it comes to an everyday or routine matter!",
        "It's likely to be an industrious day, useful for clearing any outstanding matters, if you can override the slightly judgmental vibe or pushy undercurrent. There may be a feeling that you can't quite get past one particular block. The answer/solution may be closer and/or more obvious than you realize!",
        "Flexibility, when it comes to your general/professional arena, is something that may be lacking. A Mercury/moon combination is likely to encourage slightly guarded decisions and reactions on a day where you might need to think and act quickly. It will help if important decisions can be postponed!",
        "It's a nice kind of day where you can demonstrate your warmer side with some possibly unexpected results on the romance front. That said; you may well glean some fresh insight with regard to a platonic relationship too. The latter part of the day will be particularly primed for some useful dialogue!",
        "You're likely to shift up a gear on the career front. However; the full moon in your sign suggests that you may not be entirely insightful or sensible when it comes to emotional matters and sensitive dialogue. Perhaps one exchange should be left for another time!",
        "It's certainly a day where your methodical ways should be an absolute asset. All that said; direct observations should be curbed. There is more than one way to get the point across. In addition; any serious dialogue involving your personal relationships should be postponed until tomorrow!",
        "One challenging lunar aspect, which moves in this evening, suggests that you'll feel at odds with yourself. Normally an earth-centered sign you're likely to feel tempted to break out of your normal routine or change your image, but you should hold off on making any rash decisions for today!",
        "Planetary transits may well bring a mix of opportunities and minor obstacles. If you try to accept every challenge, complete every opportunity and tackle every development, you could end the day with an unfeasible to-do list. You may need to be a little more selective!"

    "Gemini": [
        "The sun is currently exerting a lot of influence, making this one of those rather annoying days full of contradictions. Impulsive reactions should be resisted, especially on the work-front, but it's possible that someone will try to hurry you along into making a rash decision. Tread carefully!",
        "It's a day to prioritize your current commitments, since there may well be one or two loose ends to tie up.  Don't assume that everything is ticking along smoothly, either. Whatever you do, don't over-extend yourself to something just to make yourself look good, because this is likely to rebound on you!",
        "Take extra care with snap responses and judgments. Although the overriding vibe may feel stodgy, there's a propensity to dismiss a positive offer or suggestion as a negative one. It may sound counterproductive, but it may help to set your sights a little lower for a brief time!",
        "It's a day to perhaps refrain from casual comments, especially when it comes to mild flirting, since mixed signals are possible. A burst of charisma and charm has the capacity to bring out your more alluring side, but know where to draw the line: mixed signals are likely!",
        "The subtly obstructive vibe is likely to clog up your thinking processes and slow the pace down in general. Be strict with yourself from the start and don't be sidetracked by any diversions, no matter how tempting. A risk may just pay off, but you will need to be aware of what could go wrong!",
        "You could find that you're not feeling as self sufficient as you usually do. You may even feel overemotional and appear a little sentimental to the people around you. This is because of the rather intense lunar influences. Indulge it; watch a weepy film with some like minded friends!",
        "The Mercury/moon influence may create a rather mellow mood when, in fact, you need to be quite proactive. This is good news for any emotional hiccups, but less good for current schedules and deadlines. It may be a good idea to put your social plans on hold until you've dealt with more pressing matters!",
        "A self-critical mood could descend, thanks to the prickly Pluto/sun combination, which will have an impact on the way you perceive certain achievements. You could even regard one particular result in a rather one-sided way. It's perhaps a question of viewing past efforts with a more objective eye!",
        "It's a day to perhaps refrain from casual comments, especially when it comes to mild flirting, since mixed signals are possible. A burst of charisma and charm has the capacity to bring out your more alluring side, but know where to draw the line: mixed signals are likely!",
        "A mixed day may well be in store. An enthusiastic attitude will be appreciated, and will strike the right note with many. However, perhaps this won't be easy to sustain, because it's possible that you'll feel disenchanted with what may be a very minor matter. Maybe it'll be best to sleep on it!",
        "Watch out for casual and/or informal agreements. A tempting suggestion may require more clarity than today's full moon can provide. By the same token, give yourself at least a day's breathing space when it comes to signing on any dotted line in a more formal capacity!",
        "Yesterday's fraught vibe may appear to settle down; however, there could be a possible choice or dilemma on the near horizon. One particular friendship may well start to develop a slightly romantic hue. Don't rush this. It's certainly not a day to jump to conclusions, either!",
        "This could possibly turn out to be one of those days where you suddenly have a flash of inspiration or insight, which starts you thinking about your long term future. Something that you never would have considered could suddenly gain instant appeal. Career matters will benefit the most!",
        "A practical/material matter or problem may benefit from a rethink, which should lead into a constructive change in tactics. It's certainly a day to heed the distinctly cooling vibe. That is, try to avoid implementing wildly creative solutions when the simplest one will do!",
        "The Mars/moon mix is likely to bring a little sprinkling of good luck. You could even find that it's one of those days where just about everything seems to slot into place. Incoming information may have an uplifting effect, which could lead into one or two pleasant revelations later on!",
        "There's a quietly uplifting vibe. However, there's also a tendency on your part to be slightly inconsistent with others. Certain things said may be taken out of context. Being subtly flirty may lead to some unnecessary misunderstandings. It's certainly a day to be guided by someone's mood!",
        "While planetary accents are likely to create a smoldering vibe, do watch what you say. Casual dialogue will soon give way to miscommunication and mixed signals. Additionally, given the seasonal flavor of the week, do heed the boundaries that separate friendly banter from flirting!",
        "A rather determined vibe will develop, making this a day to mop up, clear up and generally settling ongoing matters. While you'll have a certain amount of cosmic leverage, do bear in mind that it may be harder than usual to bend and tweak any tacit rules to your advantage!",
        "You will find that you're concentrating on your social life after the last couple of challenging days. Not only will you be in need of company you'll also be in the mood for some fun too, which is long overdue. Take your friends bowling or out for a pizza and make the most of the evening!",
        "Cash matters look poorly-aspected. It might be that you want to make the most of the weekend, but before you do anything you might be wise to sit down with a pen and paper and work out exactly what you have in the way of spare cash. Don't overspend and you'll have a worry-free day!"

        "Communications could be a little sloppy or not entirely based in fact, thanks to a sun/moon combination. An objective, no-nonsense attitude will make short work of any minor problem, but beware of overstating the case to make your point; sometimes it's best to speak the truth gently!",
        "As the moon starts to shed some of its negative vibes, it brings some very welcome energies your way. You are already a naturally generous individual, but today you will be driven to seek out those around who may be in need of some cheering up. Their smile will be more than enough of a reward!",
        "The AM/PM split will have an up-side and a down-side when it comes to practical and material matters. While the morning is likely to see you erring on the side of caution, the afternoon may bring a much freer vibe, but one where you may be tempted to test the metaphorical boundaries a little too much!",
        "Incoming information could be useful, but not in the way you initially think. Anything that encourages snap or ill-informed decisions should be viewed with skepticism, particularly when it comes to your near term future. As an aside, there may be a change of plan, which could lead to something very beneficial!",
        "Thanks to an AM/PM split, there's a tendency to take control, although you could find that you're getting into a minor power struggle with regard to a particular relationship in the earlier hours. You may not be the only sign who has to backtrack a little around the late afternoon!",
        "Although you may notice the fretful undercurrent, there is likely to be a silver lining to any little glitches. Specifically, don't allow one minor piece of unexpected news to dominate the day, because it may be feasible to actually turn this to your advantage in the medium to long term!",
        "A fresh perspective may take you by surprise, but a little bit of competition could be just what you need to motivate yourself. That said; don't overdo it. In addition; if you try and talk your way out of any ongoing commitments to free up more time, it may be interpreted by others in the wrong way!",
        "The general vibe will be very sunny and bubbly. That said; it's a day where you could be easily sidetracked; a little unfocused, and not think things through fully. It may be that impulsive responses win will over more thoughtful ones. There's a trace of thoughtlessness to watch out for too!",
        "Dynamic influences suggest that you are likely to have a stimulating day. A visible result and/or some recognition on the work front will be what you need. However, as with other signs, you could go a little overboard if you take this too far and as a result, you could even appear quite thoughtless!",
        "Planetary influences will appear in stages today, which may give the illusion of contradictory developments. You may find that you have to switch from being blunt and direct to being gracious and tactful and then back again. It's definitely a day to go with the flow and adapt!",
        "There's a subtle sense of change in the air. This is most likely to be a little unsettling at first. However, it's still likely to be useful in the long run, if marginally inconvenient in the short term, since a swift reassessment could lead into gradual improvements, particularly in romance!",
        "Communications and incoming information are likely to be quite illuminating. Even though it's the weekend, your attention could be directed to work/career developments. While the angle is a positive one, it may be that you can't actually implement or kick start anything for a couple of days!",
        "Revitalized influences this afternoon will bring in a breath of fresh air. What may have been a slight battle or the center of some disagreement is very likely to peter out later in the day. The only note of caution is that new and developing decisions might be a little harder to stick with!",
        "If you find that you've bitten off a little more than you can chew today don't worry, because there will be someone who is more than happy to lend a guiding hand. Their methods might seem haphazard, but they will be the one to get you back on the right path again!",
        "While practical and material matters should settle, you may find that emotional matters become a little demanding. It's certainly a day to steer clear of focusing on what can't be changed. There may be a sudden and unexpected realization later in the day: if so, pay it some attention!",
        "Thanks to a highly diagnostic vibe, any slight and existing communication gaps are likely to be more noticeable today. In light of this a very slight disappointment may be on the cards. That said; this could turn out to offer more of an advantage than you initially presumed!",
        "There may well be a slower, possibly restricted vibe, which you may find hard to work with. That said; a glimpse on the immediate horizon of something better may well offer enough incentive for you to accept the pace. As an aside: there could be a genuinely positive angle to a small blunder or glitch!",
        "Sometimes there are days that just don't go right, and today is likely to be one of those days. Clashes are possible, particularly with those in charge. Perhaps someone who is usually flexible will come across as overly controlling. However, it's not a day to challenge such types!",
        "Today has the capacity to offer some useful opportunities within a more contained vibe. If there is a chance to boost your income, then take it, but only if there is no risk and/or anxiety involved. The same applies if a temporary role of responsibility becomes available on the work front!",
        "The fiery moon will supply a boost on two fronts: there'll be a surge of confidence and a surge of will-power. Use this combination for the good. Re-introduce some balance and restore what may be lacking or missing. The only downside to the vibe is a slight tendency to coast!"

        "Thanks to a subtly resistant vibe, it's likely to be a day where you'll find it more difficult to commit to anything that is too specific or too final. There may be an element of trying to keep your options open. That said; a visible lack of effort, for whatever reason, is likely to rebound in a few days' time!",
        "The full moon is likely to amplify your perfectionist traits, which will have the potential to assist the work/career front. That said; you might be a little less accommodating than usual. Take care how far you push this: the intense vibe will be affecting others in all sorts of subtle ways too!",
        "Today's supportive vibe has the capacity to provide the necessary means with which to address or remedy a recent development. The only downside may be a rather inflexible time limit or deadline. Don't be tempted to cut any corners though, no matter how tempting it may feel!",
        "Unhelpful planetary aspects highlight cash matters today, and there could be a jolt in the form of an untimely invoice or bill. Hand-in-hand with this, you'll find the lure of the mall too hard to resist, but today is not a good day to extend your credit! Try and exercise a little self-discipline, you'll be glad you did!",
        "In terms of romance there should be gradual improvements throughout the day, and by the time the evening arrives, you should find that the mood starts to warm up. Emotional matters are likely to hit an optimum point in the later hours, which is when feelings will be at their least complicated!",
        "The Mercury/moon mix indicates a need to keep your feet on the ground, with regard to news and/or fresh information. A specific problem is not likely to go away by itself, but don't be tempted to proceed along an untested course of action without some thought or consideration for the end result!",
        "Planetary shifts will bring a breezy ambiance and perhaps encourage you to adopt an overly confident approach. Take care though: don't be drawn into making any casual promises; stick to what you can do and what you know. Otherwise, by Friday you may regret empty words and guarantees!",
        "Keep your eyes firmly fixed on your chosen goal today as there will be lots of distractions that may disrupt your concentration. Someone will be looking for your input this afternoon. However, if you wish to achieve your ambitions it is important that you learn to say no sometimes!",
        "There are days when even an insightful, perceptive person will miss various signs and cues that something is not quite right. There's a strong hint of a forgotten deadline or responsibility, which could give way to some minor embarrassment tomorrow. Whatever you do, don't leave it for someone to finally lose patience!",
        "You could find that you're feeling a little restless, and the thought of staying indoors will not appeal at all! However, a pesky lunar influence will fade, which suggests that the afternoon will hold one or two pleasant developments for you. Communications and travel are well aspected after mid-morning!",
        "Airy influences will make this a very stimulating day. The planets should offer all the right guidance at the right time and you'll have an almost instinctive sense of excellent timing. That said; you may need to be a little more attentive to the usefulness of incoming information!",
        "Seemingly lighter influences may suggest that you can get away with impulsive decisions, but they could backfire. In addition; this same carefree vibe may encourage you to backpedal when it comes to an either/or decision. It may be best to not rush decisions for now!",
        "The emphasis is likely to swing to your personal or domestic life, but in a mainly positive way. Pesky old Jupiter will relinquish a lot of its hold, which indicates an upwards surge in mood, intentions, and opportunities. It's definitely a day to spend some quality time with those who matter!",
        "Improving influences in the afternoon should offset or reverse the heavier morning ones. Don't be too dismayed if plans made early in the day need a certain amount of tweaking later on; just keep your cool. There could be a little good luck adding a little extra sparkle to the end of the day too!",
        "You will be feeling quite thoughtful today and keen to expand your horizons in a meaningful and educational manner. Today would be an ideal time to take a trip to a museum or art gallery. There will be one exhibit that will have a far reaching impact in your life.",
        "The Mercury/moon influence may exude a rather effortless vibe on a day where you may achieve more by being more proactive. Don't assume that standard, everyday matters require minimum effort. Something specific, possibly on the work front, may require a firm decision or level of commitment",
        "It's a day that may call for either some sensitivity or patience, whether single, attached or planning a first date with someone new. Watch out for revealing a slightly materialistic frame of mind, which you might find hard to shake off. Counting the pennies is always sensible, but if you're on a date, do it discreetly!",
        "Money matters are looking particularly spectacular today, thanks to a very beneficial planetary formation. It could be a lucky win that boosts your finances, or an overdue reward for some hard work, but whatever it is don't let it just slip through your fingers; save it!",
        "There is a double whammy to negotiate today: a need for excitement may well override your natural caution, and a friend could pour cold water on certain plans. It might be wise to sit down with your friend in order to get to the nub of the matter and it might be wise to limit your quest for excitement just for now!"

        "The Moon makes itself known in your life today. Thanks to other planetary alignments this combination makes today an excellent day for moving things forward in your love life. There is a suggestion that there may have been some harsh words lately, now is the time to make things right again!",
        "Your cautious mood of yesterday is likely to continue, thanks to a Mars/Sun combination. While you won't be spending money like it grows on trees you won't feel any more secure by holding onto it. Let your hair down and arrange some fun that won't break the bank!",
        "You should have plenty of get-up-and-go, as long as you play to your strengths. You'll definitely impress someone if you avoid anything that requires you to be creative and fluid and focus instead on anything that enables you to be rather analytical. You can afford to go against the grain!",
        "It's a mixed day. You should find that you experience a surge of positive energy, which bodes well for practical matters. However, on the emotional front you could feel the need for some space. The planets suggest that this is a temporary phase, so being as tactful as possible is the way to go!",
        "You should find that your mood lifts, so long as you avoid heavy discussions and keep romance light or steer clear altogether. An off comment might irritate you early on, but just let it go; there's no point laboring it, because you'll get nowhere. Aim for a fun and relaxing time today!",
        "You're probably in the mood to take it easy and enjoy a stress-free day. Although you'll most likely get away with such an approach, you might want to consider using an AM/PM split to your advantage: while the evening enables fun, the daytime could see some good results with a little effort!",
        "There's a very subtle change in the planets. Restrictive forces are likely to be on their way out, but not in a way that is immediately obvious. You may feel a need to be on the lookout for any little indicators. However; there is a slight tendency to overreact to slight developments!",
        "It may be best to disregard incoming advice, since that advice, no matter how well-intentioned, might prevent you from making the most of the day. If you find that you go through a change of heart with regard to an important matter, then do seek an alternative opinion!",
        "Informal developments may well be prone to minor restrictions and constraints, thanks to a rather controlling vibe. That said; you may be inclined to attribute more importance to one matter than it really deserves. An ability to let go will be a major strength. As an aside; beware incomplete or even false news!",
        "It is possible that you could expect or even demand more than you're actually entitled to, thanks to unreliable influences. A suspicion that you've been wronged, or a feeling that you're completely in the right may need to be toned right down, or you could end up annoying those closest to you!",
        "As a water sign, you're likely to be more impervious to the downsides of the slow pace. That said; for today there is a tendency to react in an overly sensitive way to lesser developments. By the same token, you may need to take extra care with verbal agreements!",
        "A gently industrious vibe suggests that it's a day where extra effort will pay off eventually. However, since communications in general may be a trace unreliable, it may be best to stick loosely inside your comfort zone when it comes to taking on board incoming advice, at least before the early evening!",
        "The moon is exerting a rather unsettling influence on emotional matters in general for a few signs, including yours. Incoming information in the morning can be reversed during the afternoon. Check that you are all up-to-date and that there is nothing you've forgotten in your recent exchanges!",
        "There may be a rather disjointed feel to the day. If one particular matter is highlighted at all, it may be presented in the context of getting it done and getting it crossed off your list. The trick is not to rush new decisions. Discuss ongoing matters sensibly and with a little consideration for any conditions attached!",
        "It's a day where slowing down may actually help you to get more done. You may think that you're working steadily and you may not even realize that you're operating at a rushed pace, but others are likely to. Attention to detail is far more likely to secure concrete, indisputable results!",
        "Your day is likely to be the inverse of most people's, in that there's a strong possibility that someone may try to get you to guarantee something which is beyond your immediate control. That said; whether it's best to be utterly candid, or not, is likely to be fifty-fifty either way!",
        "The current vibe may feel quite restrictive when it comes to career matters. It may feel as though there's very little cooperation between colleagues. That said; running parallel to this is a subtly smoldering vibe, which bodes well for a surprise exchange, if not today, then later in the week!",
        "You may need to circumvent a slight air of resistance when it comes to a personal matter, which may resurface with a slight shift in perspective. All that said; it's possible that a minor development will steer you into a course of action that you perhaps wouldn't have otherwise considered!",
        "On an emotional level it should be a much easier day than of late. Certain issues that may have been bubbling to the surface should ease off. Reoccurring problems may well appear a lot more manageable, although you may need to bear in mind that some things might need to be deferred for another day!"

While it may be difficult to express your feelings, especially if there's a slight disappointment, try to remember that a miscommunication is the real problem!",
        "Fabulous influences may well lead to one or two lucky breaks and even if there are any minor obstacles to overcome, the planets are nicely configured to give you that extra little push. It's definitely a day where you should take the longer term view and believe that anything is possible!",
        "The lunar influences zoom in on your social zone, placing the emphasis on relationships. That said; communications are poorly aspected and there is a good chance that you could miss or overlook a message or forget to return a call. A part of the problem may well be taking someone slightly for granted!",
        "A positive string of influences indicates an excellent day in terms of your social life, whereas a challenging aspect from the moon suggests that relationships in general may need a little space. A sense of freedom will keep your mood buoyant; feeling constrained will cause a slump!",
        "You may experience a slightly frustrating day in terms of romance, but this could be down to your perception rather than to actual events. You might be feeling that you need a little space and independence, but you'll find that a little patience and understanding will help enormously!",
        "The new moon will bring a more proactive vibe, but there's also a slightly tactless vibe to negotiate too. Something that may require your full attention could get downgraded with a careless or assumptive approach. It's certainly a day to keep your eye on the metaphorical ball!",
        "Stop trying to please everyone all the time! You're driving yourself too hard and if you don't slow down there's a danger that you will miss out on fun times. Some distance is what you need most right now and a realization that you don't have to put your needs second place to everyone else's!",
        "The day may feel settled to begin with, but a pesky sun/moon combination may well slow or reverse progress in one particular area; possibly the work front. An idea or suggestion could reveal flaws and cracks that you haven't anticipated and you may need to reassess how you deal with this!",
        "Although it may not be the fun kind of day you'd like, there is a distinct emphasis on self-insights. Incoming information may offer further guidance. A very minor development could have an unsettling effect, but don't rely too heavily on your intuition; don't make snap judgments and don't assume anything!",
        "Glorious influences create a rather nice balance between your work life and social life. It'll be more than possible to impress others. However, on the romance front it may be best not to jump to any conclusions or make any assumptions – this is the one area that is likely to remain muddled for now!",
        "Planetary shifts and influences hone in on your social zone today, placing the emphasis on friendships, new and old. Communications are very well-aspected and there is a good chance that you receive a message from someone who will, in due course, become quite a fixture in your life. Reply to your emails today!",
        "There is a slightly misleading quality about the day's general vibe. It may be that nothing is as it seems. Communications may well complicate a personal matter. The best approach may well be to avoid rash or impulse decisions. Gains made today may be lost after tomorrow!",
        "Stop trying to please everyone all the time! You're driving yourself too hard and if you don't slow down there's a danger that you will miss out on fun times. Some distance is what you need most right now and a realization that you don't have to put your needs second place to everyone else's!",
        "If you have a guiding motto for today, it should be: don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today. Specifically, it may not be a good idea to brush ongoing commitments under the carpet, especially if you have any obligations still outstanding. A slight tendency to be a little unfair may need to be controlled too!",
        "It's a day where you may well need to guard against a tendency to take on far too much, far too soon. In addition; there's a slight inclination to speak directly from impulse. Giving yourself a few moments to think may help when it comes to responding to a slightly awkward question!",
        "The home environment comes under the spotlight, thanks to the lively influences, which add a burst of creativity. Not that you'll lack any staying power; far from it. Once you're settled on an idea, there will be no stopping you. However, the Venus/Pluto mix could push you a little too hard. Ease up and take your time!",
        "Improvements to the general vibe should be apparent from the start. There's an extra emphasis on romance. Although you may not be as poised as you could be, there will certainly be an endearing side, which others will appreciate. Attached Archers will be able to enjoy a couple of fun-filled hours with their partners!",
        "Despite the improving vibe, you may miss some advantageous news. Do pay attention to what is being said: incoming information may be patchy and therefore subject to misinterpretation. Not looking for littler flaws may help you to zone in constructively on a lingering matter!",
        "You can take advantage of a relatively settled day, so long as you pay attention to the definite shifts in the general vibe. Keeping a strong sense of your goal in mind will help, and don't give up if it gets a little tricky. A minor challenge may feel irritating, but it could be useful!",
        "Romance is definitely in the air, whether you're single or attached! You might find that you need to do some quick thinking, and you'll need to be quite resourceful when it comes to creating the right mood, thanks to certain financial constraints, but you should still be able to enjoy a fabulous evening!"

        "Rarely for you, it's perhaps a day that calls for a little willpower, since there is a propensity to over-estimate your capabilities. Don't readily commit to extra duties/tasks unless you really have to. It may also be a good idea to set a time-limit when it comes to a possibly complicated matter!",
        "There may be a slight tendency to dwell too much on a marginally fretful situation. It's possible that this situation won't be as bad as you assume.  That said; it may not be entirely within your control. It's perhaps a day to accept there are just some things you can't fix immediately!",
        "A tactful vibe will offer discreet support, especially when it comes to something waiting to be resolved. You should be able to deal fairly easily with a particular individual who may be either difficult to read or just outright awkward. It may be a question of figuring out the right approach!",
        "The day is likely to start out looking a little challenging; it could be that someone you were relying on lets you down through no fault of theirs, but a strong planetary influence will be quite empowering, in a subtle way. There's a hint of a surprise on the romance front too!",
        "In a similar way to Libra's horoscope you will have the potential to make some dramatic changes in your life: new courses to help career advancement or to broaden your horizons will be there for the taking, as long as you can ignore the niggling doubts. Don't fall at the first hurdle through a lack of confidence!",
        "It's not a bad day, but minor tensions could spring up out of nothing. There's a push-pull dynamic, which may increase the work load and decrease the rate of results or progress.  There may be a moment of doubt to work through too. If so, then your best strategy will be to sleep on it!",
        "You may well think that you're not functioning at your best, but that is not how others are likely to see it. The fiery vibe will create just the right balance between restraint and drive for most water signs. That said; it'll be a good idea to consider people's reactions and responses in general!",
        "It's a day where you are likely to be a little too direct and perhaps a little too honest. It just won't be in your psyche to soften the message if you feel that you're in the right. Avoid getting into any deep heart-to-hearts, especially where the subject is focused around emotional matters!",
        "While you'll be in a good position to make the most of a more resilient, if slower vibe when it comes to career matters and practical ones, you may find yourself floundering a little on the emotional front. In particular, you could inadvertently stir up done-and-dusted matters!",
        "You could find that you're a little too keen to push yourself, and others, too hard today. The underlying motivation for this current drive is a fear of failure or not wanting to appear 'second best.' Give yourself a bit of a break, there's nothing in the planets pointing to failure today!",
        "A slightly chaotic undercurrent is likely to last until tomorrow. If you're not time-pressured, then use this cosmic chaos to your advantage. A potential source of tension can be nipped in the bud more easily than presumed, and it may be easier to re-negotiate a current agreement more favorably!",
        "A surge of understated optimism, combined with incoming information suggests that you'll perhaps experience a possibly constructive eye-opening moment. That said; a slightly inflexible approach could hamper progress in subtle ways. Be a little more forgiving when it comes to someone else's ineptitude!",
        "An intense vibe may well revive a personal and/or emotional matter temporarily. Regard it as a second chance to clear the air once and for all, rather than as a time-consuming interruption. As an aside; if a very faint control issue continues to linger, don't engage with it!",
        "A subtle Venus/Neptune mix could impact on your relationships in general, but in a subtle way. Look out for mixed signals and misunderstandings. You may want to hold back, but someone, who is perhaps more impulsive, may want to move things forward. There should be enough middle ground!",
        "A relatively easy-going day is on offer if you can get into a relaxed frame of mind. However, the key word is 'if,' since you're likely to be in too much of a stubborn mood. Personal pride will perhaps be a factor too. Bear this in mind if someone comes to your aid!",
        "It's not a bad day, thanks to a tempered vibe. The communication lines should open up enough to assist or boost a personal choice or preference. In addition, it is possible that a past error, quite possibly a minor one, will be corrected in your favor. Even very low-level good luck shouldn't be questioned!",
        "It's not a bad day, if you can keep some minor grievances in perspective. It's possible that these grievances are outdated and that you'll allow your attention to be drawn away from what is actually more important. Incoming advice may be misleading or subject to misinterpretation!",
        "You are likely to be feeling a little frustrated, especially when it comes to being able to express yourself. However, it's not a day to try and influence other people's views and feelings. It may be tempting to 'speed up' a particular process, but hold off for just a little while!",
        "It's an easier day than yesterday to an extent. Money still needs a careful eye, but the opportunity to grab some fun moments is there, as long as you stop fretting about remote possibilities and focus instead on the here and now. Romance will have a chance to take off!"

If there has been a gap or a missing link of some kind, today's planetary accents may well guide you to the answer!",
        "The overriding mood for today is likely to feel a great deal less pressured. However, you may not be able to let go of something that others regard as quite trivial or unimportant. If you let it, this could actually eat into your time. It's certainly a day to draw a metaphorical line!",
        "The day holds definite potential, since a focused vibe has the capacity to give you the upper hand. That said; there's an even chance that you could just as easily slip up as anyone else. With that in mind, try not to judge or criticize other people's methods, systems and approaches!",
        "If you find yourself feeling a little reluctant to pass information on, then pause to check why. It may be based on little more than a vague notion to keep your cards close to your chest. However, it may be a risky tactic to adopt for emotional or romantic matters. This could rebound!",
        "Given the tense Pluto/moon mix, you may need to revise your approaches a little. It's possible that your expectations of others and what they can do will be a little too high. It's certainly a day that could benefit from some give-and-take. By the same token, be as fair as possible if someone asks for help from you!",
        "A rare opportunity to clear the air once and for all is likely to leave you feeling drained, but happier, especially when it comes to emotional matters that may not yet be fully resolved. Just bear in mind that if you're going to be honest, be prepared to hear the truth. Under the right conditions it's a day to move forward!",
        "The Venus/Mars combination indicates a certain amount of tension in your platonic or domestic relationships. The planets suggest that you'll be able to smooth things over, but reliability, or the lack of it, may need to be resolved. While communications are fairly aspected, they're still not brilliant!",
        "Despite the sprightly vibe, tried and untested methods may not be brilliantly well-aspected. What may seem like a good solution for a specific matter on the work front may actually give way to more issues. In addition; be wary of something that may have been over-simplified, since there may well be a hidden downside!",
        "Do bear in mind that a slightly selfish vibe could bring about a minor conflict from the afternoon onwards. You could inadvertently blunder when it comes to a verbal exchange, which in turn could impact on romantic matters in a day or so. It's definitely a time to watch what you say!",
        "The overriding mood for today is likely to feel a great deal less pressured. However, you may not be able to let go of something that others regard as quite trivial or unimportant. If you let it, this could actually eat into your time. It's certainly a day to draw a metaphorical line!"

    "Virgo": [
        "You're in line for a rather fabulous day today, thanks to a string of beneficial aspects, which are suggesting that you throw caution to the wind and do something different and out of the ordinary. You'll also be in an extremely sociable mood, so get on the phone and get your friends involved too!",
        "A slightly erratic vibe could create slight misunderstandings in your work-based relationships. You may feel that someone is perhaps being a little too cavalier or offhand. You may just need to accept that it's not a great day to confront those particular individuals!",
        "The current influences suggest two things: one: that a tendency to worry or fret should be replaced with a tendency to look on the bright side, and two; that you may now be prepared to take a bit of a gamble over 'bending the rules' slightly. A certain amount of caution wouldn't go amiss!",
        "It's likely to be a day of two halves, with the latter half being the best part. The general area to watch out for is a possible conflict between your work life and social zone. The benefits you can look forward to are likely to revolve around an unexpected invitation!",
        "Although your energy levels are likely to be fairly high, it's perhaps a day to stick to what you know and to observe those 'unspoken' rules that everyone understands. If you wish to navigate the rather contrary vibe with relative ease, steer clear of competitive impulses in the earlier hours!",
        "While there's generally an effervescent vibe, you could find that unexpected expenses cast a gloomy cloud over the late afternoon/evening; and plans for the remainder of the weekend could be foiled. That said; you don't have to resort to an all-or-nothing response; there is middle ground!",
        "Today's vibe is likely to be very subtle and barely noticeable. However; the cooperative influences will make it easier to say the right thing at the right time. Getting your own way won't seem like hard work. That said; the knack for persuasive charm is something that should be used sparingly!",
        "An airy vibe is likely to radiate a frivolous streak until the afternoon; then it may be all-change. There may be a moment where a very minor issue has the capacity to escalate, if you let it. By the same token, a miscommunication in romance should be cleared up as soon as possible!",
        "You face a day that could go either way. The accent could be on making the most of the opportunities, or on minor troubles. The mixed aspects suggest that if you can let go of something that is either redundant or at a standstill, then you'll make life easier for yourself!",
        "Mixed influences are likely to have an overall beneficial effect on your day. You should find that you have a wider margin of error, which will allow for more flexibility. You can afford to take a minor risk, and communications should improve enough to clarify an ongoing, confusing matter!",
        "That innate sixth sense or inner voice will be making a lot of sense, but you may feel disinclined to listen to it just yet. It might be wise to postpone certain ideas rather than reject them entirely. Look to the coming weekend, when new influences will encourage a more balanced approach!",
        "You're in line for a rather fabulous day today, thanks to a string of beneficial aspects, which are suggesting that you throw caution to the wind and do something different and out of the ordinary. You'll also be in an extremely sociable mood, so get on the phone and get your friends involved too!",
        "There's a more disciplined vibe in general and while this may feel a little dry, there's certainly the capacity to gain a marginal advantage when it comes to an informally competitive event. That said; do be aware of your limits. Don't try to extend your success beyond a small gain or achievement!",
        "A chaotic vibe suggests that you could waste time pursuing one specific matter. When it comes to a possibly convoluted either/or choice, erring on the side of caution may be best for now. On the romantic front, the mood may feel a little too superficial, but give something a little more time!",
        "Today's rather spirited vibe may not be such great news, since it could bring with it a degree of indecisiveness that you find quite irksome. You may have the answers for today, but don't be lulled into assuming that you won't need to adjust or tweak one matter or course of action!",
        "Communications are well-aspected, but you may feel reluctant to act on any incoming information. By the same token, there's perhaps a slight tendency to adopt a gloomier outlook. A nagging feeling or voice that you could do better, or be better, is what may be behind this!",
        "Something that seems to have been going very wrong could finally be rescued and/or corrected today, thanks to subtle shifts in the cosmos. However; because lingering doubts could give rise to a few reservations, it might be a sensible strategy to avoid looking for hidden meanings!",
        "A sensitive undercurrent is likely to offer enough guidance to give the right responses and answers, particularly when it comes to a possibly tricky issue. That said; it may be harder than it sounds to generate a positive attitude, especially when it comes to something that is perhaps just beginning to needle you!",
        "If you experience a sudden desire to get everything perfect, don't worry. Lunar influences will be to blame. If you don't know where to start in order to create a better or easier working environment, then maybe you should leave it for another day, when you're less likely to hit a time-consuming glitch!",
        "The shifting vibe will appear to bring in an overtly flexible feel to the day. However; this flexibility could actually contain a dismissive undercurrent. Don't be too offhand about a problem or matter close to home and don't be too blasé about a supportive issue and/or a promise to assist someone!"
